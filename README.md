Food Delivery App – Agile Scrum Simulation

This repository contains the Agile project artifacts for our Food Delivery App, developed as part of the Agile Software Development course.
The project follows the Scrum framework with defined roles — Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers — and was executed across multiple sprints.
All Agile elements such as Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, User Stories, Burn-down and Burn-up charts, and Trello workflow are documented here.
GitHub is used for version control and CI/CD integration, simulating real-world Agile-DevOps practices.
